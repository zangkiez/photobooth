# Photobooth

Photobooth turns a connected camera and screen into an offline-friendly photo booth for events on Linux and Windows. It runs on your own hardware (Pi, PC, mini‑PC) and ships features like countdowns, live preview, photo/collage workflows, filters, printing and a gallery.

## Start here

- Install & setup: begin with the [prerequisites](install/prerequisites.md) and pick an [install guide](install/index.md) for your platform.
- Upgrade: follow the [update guide for Linux](update/update-linux.md) and check the [changelog](changelog.md) for release details.
- Customize: tweak sounds, themes and styles in [Customizing](customizing/index.md).
- Troubleshoot: find answers in the [FAQ](faq/index.md) and [tutorials](faq/tutorials.md).
- Community: join the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/PhotoboothGroup) or read the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md).

## What Photobooth is (and is not)

- Self-hosted event software that stays local after setup and does not require cloud services or accounts.
- Not a hosted website where guests upload from home, nor a permanent online gallery or full image editor.
- Requires a supported OS and basic configuration; it is not a one‑click kiosk appliance.

## Project background
Photobooth was initially developed by Andre Rinas ([original source](https://github.com/andreknieriem/photobooth)). In 2019 Andreas Skomski continued the work and, together with the community, grew Photobooth into the feature-rich project you see today.

## News and releases
Catch up on recent announcements, release highlights and community updates in the [News](news.md). Full version details are listed in the [Changelog](changelog.md).

Overall the code got optimized and cleaned up. There's also a lot of new options added.

Photobooth is now again compatible with Windows, also PHP8 won't cause trouble.

If you find a bug you're welcome to report it on the [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/PhotoboothProject/photobooth/issues).

[Update instructions](update/index.md) have been updated, you can now easily update your existing git installation of Photobooth using the photobooth installer!

Enjoy Photobooth v4!
